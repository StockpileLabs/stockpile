# Stockpile

A global contribution engine for Web3, powered by Solana. Funding, without barriers.

## What is Stockpile?

Stockpile is a web3 protocol designed to facilitate numerous different types of crowdfunding in a permissionless manner. The protocol leverages the Solana blockchain to provide quick, easy, and composable crowdfunding experience to meet the needs of many digital fundraisers. 

## Project Goals

Stockpile is currently undergoing closed beta and will be available to the public at a later date within the near future. In the meantime, the project plans to accomplish the following:

- Grant style funding
- Token-Enabled Project Fundraisers
- Yield Contribution
- Javascript/Typescript SDK
- Integrated on/off-ramps for Web2 native users

## Why?

Formerly Mobius Protocol, the Stockpile project was conceptualized during the Freedom Convoy. Our team believes in freedom of transaction, and seeing how the events unfolded for the convoy inspired us to take a different stance on the traditional crowdfunding model. We sought to right the wrongs of platforms GoFundMe that deliberately censor legitamite fundraisers for disagreements in a ToS sheet. The result, is the Stockpile project.
