Funding Without Barriers. 

Create and contribute to decentralized crowdfunds powered by Solana. Take advantage of the fastest blockchain available to fund your own cause, charity, or project, and take part in a community dedicated to helping people. Track reputation through commemorative NFTs that mirror inputs like GitHub, and be sure the fundraiser you're contributing to is really building.

## Project Goals

Stockpile is currently live on the devnet and will be available on mainnet at a later date within the near future. In the meantime, here's our roadmap for this repository:

- Data compression
- Javascript/Typescript SDK
- Minimal Anti Collusion Infrastructure
- Quadratic Funding
- Generative Multi-Sig Beneficiaries
- Embedded Job-Postings / Bounties
- Yield Contribution
- Fully configurable "Misc" fundraiser type

## Why?

Formerly Mobius Protocol, the Stockpile project was conceptualized during the Freedom Convoy, and their situation with GoFundMe and the Canadian Government. Seeing similar events unfold throughout 2022 energized us to build the premier crowdfunding tool for Web3: free of censorship, and fully verifiable. As we built the platform, we've recognized the potential for Stockpile to be something more than a platform or primitive alone. Our vision is a robust global funding engine that can serve the needs of many, whether it be through our own platform, composability with another protocol, or tools for other use-cases built by other developers.

Here we are in 2023, pushing to make that vision a reality by working with the brightest individuals, best charities, and disruptive projects on Solana.
